        <h2>Education Background</h2>
        <p><strong>My educational journey began at Costa Rica National High School, </strong>where I completed my Senior High School education. These six years were marked by numerous trials and difficulties that tested my resilience and determination.
 <br><div>
One of the biggest challenges I faced was the daily trek across seven mountains from my town to the neighboring town where the school was located. Each week, I had to carefully budget my allowance of 50 pesos to sustain myself with rice for six days before returning home.
 <br>
Despite the hardships, I remained patient and determined to complete my high school education. With unwavering faith and the strength provided by God, I overcame the obstacles along the way and successfully graduated from high school.
 <br>
Transitioning to college was another significant milestone. Despite financial constraints and the doubts of my parents due to our family's poverty, I was resolute in pursuing higher education. I made a promise to myself that I would do everything in my power to attend college, graduate, and pursue my dreams.
 <br>
Through the grace of God, I fulfilled that promise and graduated from college, taking significant steps towards realizing my aspirations. My journey through the challenges of high school and college has shaped my determination, resilience, and unwavering faith in the face of adversity.
